#FAQ

## General FAQ

### Isn't this a bit complex?
Yes. This is intentional. Entries for the directory should be lovingly crafted.
This way, each entry must have been created by a person, vetted by a person, and
therefore suitable for reading by people.

This multistep process should ensure that those submitting entries mean it. 

I might make a tool sometime that helps generate your initial entry file.

### Is there a list of icon tags?
No. You can, however, browse existing entries in the directory and view their XML.

I plan, in the future, to create a full list that you can view.

### How long before my entry appears on site?
It depends. I do not have a merge schedual established yet.

### Are there any limits on what my entry file can be called?
Pleanty.

* Entry files must have **no** spaces in their name.
* Entry file names **must** closely reflect the title or identity of the file
* No *needless* profanity, please
* There **must** be one and only one dot in the file name and it must go before the word entry. 
* Files are named like this: Any-Thing-appropriate-99.entry
* Entry files must be valid XML.

### Is there a charge?
No. 

If you want to offer cash, gifts, cups of coffee, or something, you will find ways to do so if you explore all my stuff. 
I'm not looking for money or stuff - just great links people will love.

### I'm having a problem and need help
I'm sorry to hear that. 

Give your problem a google - this often solves problems.

If Google is not helpful, drop by the discussions tab and try to explain what you need help with.


## Books FAQ

### May I propose new sub-genre cateories?
Yes, you may do so. New sub-folders will be considered when *and only when* the parent category has at least six entries.

### Will my book remain indefinitly?
Probably.

It might be moved as we fill out genres. Supply a few sensible genre tags to 
guide future updates or sumbit a pull request with your own move commited.

### My book fits several genres, may I make an entry for each?
No. 

Once one person does that, others will and before long keeping track of everything will be a nghtmare.

Thus: One book, one entry.

Please select the genre of best fit and list the others in the genres tag.


## Authors FAQ

### Will my author entry remain indefinitly?
Probably not.

At least not without occasional updates.

As the authors' section grows, the chance of profiles with dead links grows too.
If dead links are found on an entry, it may be edited or removed.

Please keep your author entry up to date and submit a new pull request with your changes.

Also, if you hit the news for doing something bad, I may opt to remove your profile entry. I'm not shooting for exhaustive but for excellence.

### How many socials/icons can I use
As many as does not look spammy. My rule of thumb is that they should fit on one line when viewed from my desktop browser.

### Must the author entry I submit be about me?
Mostly, yes. 

Well researched entries for other authors may be considered if sufficient due dilligence appears to have been applied.

As these are profiles of living people, speedy delition is always a possibility.

### May I make more than one entry for the same author?
No. 

Please do not do this. Better to have one fully loaded entry than several fragmented ones.
